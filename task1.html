        <h3>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology.Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial is a memorial dedicated to the former president of the Republic of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam located in Peikarumbu, Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. The memorial was designed and constructed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a tribute to Kalam and to display the cultural heritage and ethnic diversity of India. It was officially inaugurated by the prime minister of the Republic of India Narendra Modi on 27 July 2017. A symbol of national integration, the memorial is an amalgamation of Mughal and Indian architecture.
            Kalam died on 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. The lecture was supposed to be 4000 words, but only after speaking the initial two sentences, Kalam collapsed and he was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest later at a hospital.[3] Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July.[4]

Following Kalam's death, the Indian Minister of Home Affairs called an emergency meeting of the Union Council of Ministers, attended by Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi. In the meeting, a proposal to build the "Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam National Memorial" was finalised. The Indian Government proposed to perform Kalam's funeral service at Raj Ghat-(Ekta Sthal) in New Delhi, and build a memorial there. Kalam's family objected, since Kalam had wanted to be buried in his hometown, Rameshwaram, and the Indian government agreed to go along with the family's wishes,[5][6] and in the same year on Kalam's birth date which is on 15 October, the commencement of construction on a memorial at Rameshwaram was publicized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.[7] On 27 July 2017, on the occasion of Kalam's second death anniversary, the memorial was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi</h3>

        <h3>Kalam studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired a degree in Physics from Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the Madras Institute of Technology to pursue aerospace engineering. His dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed the qualifier by a narrow margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions were available with the IAF.
            After that, he got a job as a scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). He also worked under eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai.
            Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At ISRO, he was the Project Director of the satellite launch vehicle (SLV) that successfully deployed the satellite Rohini into orbit in 1980. It was India’s first SLV.
            Kalam also worked to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).
            He was also the director of two projects, Project Valiant and Project Devil for developing ballistic missiles from the SLV technology. His research and leadership led him to the directorship of an advanced missile development programme.
            When R Venkataraman was the Defence Minister, Kalam was appointed the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme that was a project aimed at developing a fleet of missiles.
            He was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ for his work in the development of ballistic missile technology.
            From 1992 to 1999, Kalam was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of the DRDO. Kalam was the Chief Project Coordinator during the Pokhran II tests. During this time, Kalam became India’s best-known scientist.
            In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had won by a huge margin. He was the first scientist to become India’s President and incidentally the first bachelor too.
            Kalam’s term as the president which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial for the office of the president itself. He came to be called the People’s President. His popularity soared among the people, especially school children. He visited many parts of the country and his speeches became popular for their motivational content.
            Despite pressure from the people to have him stand for a second term, he decided not to contest.
            After the presidency, Kalam became a visiting professor at the IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Shillong, IIM Indore, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Anna University, etc.
            Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 2015. There was widespread grief expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a 7-day state mourning. The governments of various other countries as well as the United Nations expressed their grief.
            He was laid to rest with full state honours at his native Rameswaram.
            Abdul Kalam was a man of integrity who was known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth after his death barring a few personal possessions which included his books, laptop, etc.
            He was knowledgeable in the teachings of various religions and had become a symbol of inter-faith dialogue.</h3>
